## Introduction

*"Lines"* is a collection of reading record, plans, and excerpt of lines that users choose to
record. Users can record everything about reading through *Lines*:
- **Make a list of books they want to read.**
- **Make a list of books that friends and family recommend.**
- **Make a list of books they have finished.**
- **Have a record note of excerpts and lines they loved from books, movies, etc.**
- **Track their current reading stage: how many pages and percentage have they read.**
- **Set up a reading plan.**
- **Track the completion of the plan.**
- **Record the feels and thoughts of reader when reading the book. Sometimes it can be
arguments to a point, or an insight inspired by the passage.**

Anyone who love reading and want to read books can use it! Whatever the age and grade,
people can use it whenever they need *Lines*. Especially for lovers of reading, *Lines* 
can help them manage the records and record their notes about their reading. For those
who love to keep lines they have read as treasure, *Lines* provide a big convenience for
recording.

The creator of *Lines*, me, came up with this idea because I am the person described
above. Usually what I did is put the lists of books I finished and want to read in my
memo. And write down my favourite sentences in my excerpt book. However, sometimes it
is hard to bring, and I have to spend a lot of time to sort and write them. But with 
*Lines*, I can type as soon as I open it. Also, it is portable.
