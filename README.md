## Introduction

*"Lines"* is a collection of reading record, excerpt of lines, and lists of books that 
users can use. Users can record almost everything about reading through *Lines*:
- **Make lists of books based on different function.**
- **Record notes while reading (the feels and thoughts of reader when reading the book. 
Sometimes it can be arguments to a point, or an insight inspired by the passage).**
- **Track their current reading stage.**
- **Record lines they loved.**

Anyone who love reading and want to read books can use it! Whatever the age and grade,
people can use it whenever they need *Lines*. Especially for lovers of reading, *Lines* 
can help them organize their reading stage and record their notes when reading. For those
who love to keep lines they have read as treasure, *Lines* provide a big convenience for
recording.

The creator of *Lines*, me, came up with this idea because I am the person described
above. Usually what I did is putting the lists of books that I finished and want to read 
in my memo. And write down my favourite sentences in my excerpt book. However, sometimes 
it is hard to bring, and I have to spend a lot of time to sort and write them. But with 
*Lines*, I can type as soon as I open it since it is within computers.
